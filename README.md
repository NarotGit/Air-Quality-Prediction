### Air is what keeps humans alive. Monitoring it and understanding its quality is of immense importance to our well-being.
__Objective__: To estimate the air pollution level using past data-set and to predict the increasing pollution levels after a specific time period.


• Dataset: This dataset is manually prepared from different sites for hyderabad city(which is around just 1200 readings) and dataset is provided in repository.


• This repository consists of files required to deploy a __Machine Learning model__ to predict Air Quality and Web app ___created with Flask___.<br>
